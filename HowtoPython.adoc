[NOTE]
====
A sample note admonition.
We can use gemoji icons in the Asciidoctor markup.
We assign an icon name to the document
attributes `tip-caption`, `note-caption` and `important-caption`.

TIP: It works!

IMPORTANT: Asciidoctor is awesome, don't forget!

CAUTION: Don't forget to add the `...-caption` document attributes in the header of the document on GitHub.

WARNING: You have no reason not to use Asciidoctor.
